# Networks-Coursework
A record of the Network Programming assignment completed in year 2 of my undergraduate degree.

This assignment has two main parts:

Instant Messenger Application (45 marks):

Develop a server-client messaging application in Python.
The server should display a welcome message to a newly connected client and announce the client's connection to other clients. It should handle multiple client connections and not crash when a client disconnects.
Clients should be able to send messages to the server, which then relays these messages to all connected clients. Messages should be prefixed with the client's username.
On connection or disconnection, the client's username is announced to all other connected clients.
Error handling is crucial; the server must manage various potential issues, including clients crashing, losing connection, or trying to send messages without a set username.
A log file server.log needs to be generated, documenting all connections, disconnections, and messages.
Wireless Network Analysis (40 marks):

Analyze a hypothetical wireless network consisting of an access point (X) and two nodes (A and B).
Sketch the network topology showing nodes X, A, and B.
Describe the transmission procedure in the given scenario, indicating when each node transmits and for how long.
Design a protocol to address a potential issue in the transmissions, explaining the issue, your solution, and detailing the steps of your protocol.
Submission Requirements:

Submit four files: server.py, client.py, server.log, and a .pdf file for the wireless network analysis.
Compress all files into a single .zip file named "YourNameYourBannerID.zip" and upload it to Blackboard Ultra.
Assessment Criteria:

Functionality and implementation of the server and client programs (30 marks).
Creation and content of the log file (5 marks).
Error handling in the application (10 marks).
Wireless network topology sketch (5 marks).
Transmission procedure description (15 marks).
Protocol design (20 marks).
Code quality (8 marks).
Presentation and readability of the .pdf file (7 marks).
Code Quality and Presentation:

Code should be concise, well-structured, and follow the PEP 8 style guide.
Comments should be used effectively, avoiding excess.
No redundant code or unnecessary complexity.
The report should be focused, with clear and concise language.
Ideas should be presented coherently, potentially using visual aids like tables or figures.
Consistency in formatting and legible fonts, especially in figures.
The deadline for submission is February 10th, 2022, at 2pm. Compliance with university plagiarism and collusion rules is mandatory.
